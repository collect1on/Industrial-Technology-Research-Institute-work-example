# Industrial-Technology-Research-Institute Generative AI Internship Project Work Example (Dec 2024 ‚Äì Apr 2025)

This repository documents my work during my internship at the **Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Taiwan**, as part of the **Generative AI Large Language Model Project**.
Due to a **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**, I am unable to share the project source code. Instead, this repository serves as a record of my contributions and includes presentation slides that summarize my work.

## üìå Project Highlights

### 1. Traditional Chinese Table VQA Dataset

* Scraped **25,000+ Wikipedia pages** for raw data.
* Extracted, cleaned, and parsed **table contents into JSON**.
* Rendered structured tables into **table images** using an automated tool.
* Generated **10,000+ Question-Answer pairs** via the GPT-4 API to support Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks.

### 2. Novel Evaluation Metric

* Independently designed the **"Redundancy Penalty Accuracy"** metric.
* Addressed the absence of a standardized evaluation method for **table recognition and reconstruction tasks**.

### 3. Model Fine-Tuning & Performance

* Fine-tuned **Qwen2.5-VL** using targeted synthetic data generated via GPT-4.
* Achieved a **17% improvement in accuracy** (from **75% ‚Üí 92%**) on table recognition benchmarks.
